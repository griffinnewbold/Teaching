# Teaching
A GitHub Repo for storing documents and other materials related to my work as a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science Department at Columbia University.

## Introduction
Hello I am Griffin, I am currently a Teaching Assistant at Columbia University and I TA for Professor Adam Cannon. I have been a TA since my second semester of college (Spring 2022) and I have been one ever since. Essentially for whichever class Professor Cannon is lecturing that semester, I am a TA for. The trend currently has been in the Fall semesters to be a TA for COMS 1002: Computing in Context and in the Spring semesters COMS 1004: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java

I very much love my job, it brings me joy to watch others learn right before my eyes.

## Repo Purpose
As the main heading and description says, this will store all of my content related to teaching, of course you may also find it on canvas for the course when the time is right but for potentially larger files and to keep a clean record of everything I have made (hell even this is missing the oldest materials) it will all be uploaded here first before being posted to canvas, students wishing to get an early start on the content can view it here. Have a good day!!
