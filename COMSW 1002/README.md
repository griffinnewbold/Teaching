# COMS W1002: Computing in Context

An introductory course designed primarily for nonmajors to programming and Computer Science principles. The course is taught in Python as it
is one of the more beginner friendly languages. The first half of the course is a generic programming course whereas in the second half the 
assignments and labs begin to cater to specific "contexts" that allow students to gain more experience programming in their selective area of
expertise, the following are the contexts that are available to all students:

1. Computing in Economics
2. Computing in Social Sciences
3. Computing in Linguistics
4. Computing in Biology
5. Computing in Art

Students learn the essentials of programming in Python and are taught much about their respective contexts along the way. Students who become
interested in Computer Science and want to major/minor in it have the ability to continue and be successful in COMS W1004. The course contains
weekly problem sets along with the lectures 2x a week and a required hour long lab. In terms of grading the course is roughly graded along these
lines:

1. Problem Sets
2. Lab Attendance
3. Midterm Exam

The weights of these may change overtime so I will omit them, please refer to your current syllabus for more information on grading.
