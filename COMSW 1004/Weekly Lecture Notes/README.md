# Weekly Lecture Notes

Due to a curriculum refresh in the Spring 2023 semester, I attended the course myself (which was not required) and I helped alleviate 
some of the stress that the Professor had by answering the bulk of in class questions on the discussion board so there were fewer interruptions.
I also in this time decided to draft up weekly lecture notes in my own style on the topics discussed so student had a refresh of what had been
taught that week in lecture, weeks with midterms did not contain notes since minimal content was ever taught during an exam week. 

I altered the style in which I wrote the notes after the first midterm for the course, taking after the style that my course instructor 
for another course I took the previous semester had used in his course notes that he wrote for each lecture.
