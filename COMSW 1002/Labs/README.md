# Labs

A core component of the course is the weekly labs that students are required to attend that gives them a relaxed environment to consolidate the material they have learned during lecture that week and complete a short assignment that is graded in a way that rewards effort put in to learning the material.

The labs are held by teaching assistants and are divided up by context, a student must attend a lab within their specific context and they had to register for it within the first days of the academic year. 

Personally, I am an economics context teaching assistant, this information will be displayed on the course homepage when it becomes relevant.
