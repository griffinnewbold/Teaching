## COMS W1004: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java

A general introduction to computer science for science and engineering students interested in majoring in computer science or engineering. Covers fundamental concepts of computer science, algorithmic problem-solving capabilities, and introductory Java programming skills. Assumes no prior programming background.

During semester I TA for the course it is taught by Professor Adam Cannon of Columbia's Computer Science Department, students can expect to learn the following topics over the course of the semester:

1. Formal definitions of Computer Science and Algorithms
2. Pseudocode 
3. Searching Algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search
4. Sorting Algorithms: Selection Sort and Insertion Sort
5. Basics of Algorithmic Analysis: Introduction to Big-O notation
6. Fundamentals of Java Programming: Variables, Conditionals, Loops, Taking User Input
7. Principles of Object Oriented Design: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
8. More Java Topics include: Arrays, ArrayLists, Files and Exception Handling
9. Ending with discussion of Recursion and Java Generics


Students demonstrate proficiency in the lectured topics through many means such as completing weekly problem sets which are either coding exercises completed through Codio or written problems which will be assigned out of the textbook. While the structure of the course's grading has changed between the semesters I have been a teaching assistant the general structure will look something as follows:

1. Problem Sets: 50%
2. Midterms or Quizzes: 20%
3. Final Examination: 30%
