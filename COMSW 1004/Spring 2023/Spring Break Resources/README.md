# Spring Break Resources

Over the course of Spring Break, I held 3 review sessions that allowed students who felt behind in the material to have the opportunity
to catch back up and become slightly ahead of other students who had strictly attended lectures. 

Two of these sessions were recorded and posted as unlisted videos on Youtube:
